here and my microphone is nice and loud so i'll just keep talking like this until oh very nice all right i i do want to welcome everyone again what a beautiful beautiful day it is and a great day to be in god's house uh if you don't have kids or children i'll just let you know there's all kinds of children that are going upstairs to be taught of the lord and ministered to and we have i believe our junior high in high school or went this way they have a special time together as well so i want to first let us start off with our declaration and if you're new here we like to make decrees because we feel like the words that come out of our mouth we don't feel like it it's our conviction okay that the words that come out of our mouth literally shape our future and shape our world and this was something that i had shared with my children years and years ago we started learning it and then one day i thought well this is a great confession that we should all make so we're going to do this together i was created by god for a great purpose his divine power now gives me everything i need to fulfill it what jesus did through the incarnation the cross the resurrection the ascension and the enthronement as king was for me and all the created order i am filled and empowered by the holy spirit i live to advance his kingdom to bring him glory and enjoy him forever no weapon formed against me shall prosper there are angels assigned to my life and i will always be an overcomer lord as we spend these next few moments lord just exhorting and sharing your word and just saying these are things that the spirit of god is releasing and speaking to us and speaking through the spirit speaking through the word i just asked lord that you would cause that that word like a seed to land in good soil today in our hearts in my heart or even as i share it in each one's heart i thank you that you've brought us together today as the body of christ the ecclesia that you've called out lord and given us assignments in your kingdom so we thank you for that in jesus name amen amen so whether you know it or not surprise surprise i've been teaching a series over the last month or two months okay there's little chuckles here and puzzling looks in the front row um but uh about a month and a half ago i spoke about loving god and about how that even if you look at the old testament it's just it's just an unfolding of god's covenant love toward us from the very beginning and many people look at the old testament they just see judgment and wars and bad kings and evil things and and it's like i don't see the love of god there well you just have to look a little closer okay because it it is totally there and then a few weeks later because we had guests and other things going on i spoke about loving the word and that god needs to and we need to god gives us and we need to just kind of receive this hunger for his word and you'll if you'll be honest there are times in your life if you're a believer where you had more hunger and then got distracted perhaps and then something took place and you got more hunger well let's go from strength to strength faith to faith and glory to glory and hunger to hunger amen we don't we're not perfect okay we don't do all the right things all the right time but god gives us grace amen so loving the word because the word is powerful it's living it's active and then so today for all this time i thought my third point is going to be loving one another i thought that's a great point amen and i'm glad we got a full house here so you can look around say here's some people i gotta love now whether i want to or not and i have to run down here and get my cameraman follow me please uh i forgot to get the remote i'm a rookie and so we'll get things moving if you can help me get the first one up there here are uh before you go there before we go there in keeping with that theme uh here's the scripture john 13 34 and 35 jesus said a new commandment i give to you that you what that you love one another even as i have loved you that you also want love one another by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another you know another time the pharisees they tried to trip jesus up as they were continually doing and they said okay what's the greatest commandment well jesus said the greatest commandment is this love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and the second is like it but it might be a little harder love your neighbor as yourself he went on to say all of the law and all the prophets they hang on these two commandments these two commandments were so powerful that jesus said everything about the law and the prophets they hang on these two things loving the lord your god with all your heart and your neighbors yourself what if america practiced that in in in total okay it'd be hard to have much crime if everyone loved their neighbor as themselves you know and we could go on and on so you know this was jesus priority and uh so i want us i want us to look at this there's a lot of one another's in the bible and i knew that so this this thing of loving god or loving one another theme today was going to have some other nuances in it because as i was preparing there was just other things that i wanted to share so go ahead and roll the tape there if you would please you might have to read this really fast i don't know all right love one another as you see that command is 16 times uh in the new testament in the bible be devoted to one another honor one another above yourselves live in harmony with one another build up one another be like minded towards one another accept one another admonish one another greet one another care for one another serve one another and you're all thinking yeah i do that one good i don't do that one very well bear one another forgive one another be patient with one another speak the truth in love to one another be kind and compassionate to one another submit to one another we all like that one consider ourselves better consider others better than yourselves thank you for stopping that look to the interests of another bear with one another teach one another comfort one another encourage one another exhort one another stir up i like that one stir up and provoke one another to love and good works see i try to do that with my children and they just think i'm bothering them you know i'm really trying to stir them up in love you know for good works show hospitality to one another enjoy the gifts that god has given us for the benefit of one another so we see in the new testament uh you know loving god loving his word but a big huge responsibility of the body is loving our neighbor or loving one another you say okay pastor that's not very complex it does sound simple but i believe that god created a context for us to practice that and for that to become a reality what's that context it's called the church it's called a community of believers that can't stand to be together but feel they have to out of religious obligation no i don't think that's what jesus had in mind but it's a community called the church so that there's a culture that comes out of that community that looks like heaven see our culture here if we're practicing all of those one another's and someone comes in he'll say i've never seen anything like this before this is just like heaven everybody loves one another encourages one another stirs up one another shows hospitality they encourage they comfort they you know on and on and on that's a culture that god has for his church and we call it this building a kingdom culture so loving one another is really building a kingdom culture and god has said that's why we have the church of all kinds of different sizes and the church universal throughout the earth that is looking like more and more like heaven and doing the things not just when we're here in these four walls but doing the thing so we i'll just review these quickly you've seen them before but we've been trying to practice a life of honor we think that's one of the values of that kingdom culture and i'm going to use the word community because we are a community and so uh honor and then the other one is to serve a willingness to serve a desire to grow and then we are anointed to lead and we're also free to love so those are values that are within this community within this kingdom culture so you know and i'm just giving you truth that you know is in the word and you're saying okay i wonder when he's going to really give us a zinger there might not be any zingers in this message okay but quite honestly i don't always do a great job at those things i don't always do a great job at that whole long list of one another but i believe there's also a way that that culture which is us and this community and this kingdom culture gets connected and i want to highlight that that's kind of what i'm going after and i'm going to give you my three points up front and we'll just leave that up there you'll be looking at that for a while because i'm going to do amazing things on the whiteboard behind you okay so the three points are this anointing anointing you are anointed you are anointed secondly aligning you are being aligned and these things are are things that are happening by the holy spirit they're not man directed okay they might be man participated but they're first and foremost things of the spirit and then thirdly assigning anointing aligning and assigning so a few weeks ago i just dropped in my spirit we are in a season of aligning and assigning okay so i would say at least i can say that for our church and even in my life in the life of other leaders we're in a season where god wants to further clarify our aligning and our assigning and i believe that's a work of the holy spirit see in this church even though we can look at other churches and other leaders and read good things and all of that we want to be presence directed presence driven we want to defer to what the holy spirit is speaking to us he may be speaking something similar to a church down the street or whatever but we're not our priority that's why worship is a priority because we value the presence of god that first thing of a life of honor honor has to do with what we do with our lives so what we do with our lives we honor god so we want to hear what the spirit as revelation says what the spirit of the lord is saying to the church excuse me so all of this is by the holy spirit so that first point anointing okay anointing the last time i was anointed physically with oil a couple of months ago in this church on my forehead that somebody you know we had prayer going on and we were anointing people the oil to be prayed for maybe i can't remember the specific uh thing that was for but all of a sudden i was on fire my forehead was burning my first thought was wow i've never had that sensation before like this is amazing then i started smelling i said i smell cinnamon somebody spiked the oil with cinnamon and it was burning on my forehead i think i'm having an allergic reaction to the anointing or something of that nature but the first and fourth the whole bible old testament is new you read all for you out there that need those dots i got those dots going on there so but one of the first clear pictures and you guys can put that scripture up there is jesus when he went into the temple he comes out from the baptism his baptism goes into the desert and then he comes into the temple so this is a major transition time in jesus life he's getting ready for ministry it says the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to proclaim the release to the captives recovery of sight to the blind and set free those who are oppressed is there any more in that scripture i think so is that it all right yeah that's it okay so the first thing we see is the model of jesus being anointed just like this david was anointed of course jesus is the son of david so he is anointed and from there after that anointing what happens he goes into all of his next three years of ministry his full assignment the purpose of god why he was incarnate while he was on the earth but the 30 years leading up to that was all aligning him was all getting him prepared you know for the assignment and the anointing that was on his life we know that when jesus was baptized the holy spirit in the form of a dove came upon him so and all through the word he is called the anointed one so i wanna i want you to know as sons and daughters of god just like jesus you are anointed now i know most of you have heard that over and over but many of you haven't practiced that or felt that or you just need to be reminded of that so in this house we strongly affirm that the holy spirit is still anointing sons and daughters today all right the next verse john uh 2 first john 2 27 it says as for you the anointing that you receive from him abides in you and you have no need for anyone to teach you but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie and just as has taught you you abide in him so jesus was anointed we are anointed that little phrase you don't have any need anyone to teach you that doesn't mean you don't need teachers because all through the word the fivefold giftings one of those is teachers but we recognize it's the holy spirit that ultimately teaches us amen all right so let me get i want to go to a couple of accounts can everybody see this okay do i i'll would i slide it over a little bit all right genesis 28 one of my favorite passages uh in the bible because there's so much revelation there and you've heard me preach it before but i'm stirring you up by way a reminder you know the story jacob uh abraham isaac jacob okay jacob's the grandson of abraham and what is he carrying he is carrying a covenant promise of god okay that there was that abraham out of his seed that would be a great nation but he's a schemer he was born a schemer he was born a deceiver he was born a heel grabber and he stole the birthright and the blessing or he got the birthright and he's and he kind of tricked his way into getting the blessing and so by now his brother esau is ready to kill him literally and so he thought you know what this is a season for me to be realigned somewhere else geographically if i want to stay alive and so he hikes out of town and he's headed to i believe laban's house and if you pick up if you want to turn there in genesis 28 it's not going to be on your screen but it just says he came to a certain place he lighted upon a certain place you know that word is an intercessory word it means he it wasn't just random you know how butterflies look like they're random and then they they land somewhere even though it looks like it's random it's not they go somewhere they have a purpose and that word came upon is the word paga he lighted upon this is really important because this word place is really important in these next few verses and we're going to spend a bunch of time there but how many of you know the place that you were in is important ever been in the wrong place before at the wrong time it's like i shouldn't be here you know could be you know wherever you know it's just like yeah i shouldn't be at this place i was telling somebody yesterday we did prayer walking with tom demery uh after the election needed just as much prayer after the election as before and uh went through philadelphia in some of the places that i was prayer walking by myself because we split up to cover more ground faster and i'm like should i really be here i'm not sure i should be here in this place right now but i said well i'm on assignment so god's protecting me so place is important and it says he came to a certain place certain place and we're not going to get into a whole bunch of this but let me just check back with my notes so as he comes into this place what happens he sees this happening he sees as he goes to sleep he takes this rock he puts it down at his head the scripture says takes a stone and he has this vision this dream god is standing above angels are ascending and descending and basically the lord just rehearses the covenant promise to abraham i'm going to give you the land i'm going to make your descendants like the dust of the the dust of the sea or the sand of the sea and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed north south east and west behold i'm with you i'm going to keep you wherever you go i'm going to bring you back here i won't leave you until i've done what i promised to you jacob awoke and said surely the lord is in this place and i didn't know it the lord is in this place and i didn't know it this is none other than house of god this is the gate of heaven so how awesome is this place when god sends you and makes you part of a local church a community of believers that is a place i've always felt strongly convicted about that that god i need to be there was only one time in my history that i really wasn't in a place i was in bible school and of course that was a place and we had services on sunday afternoon and all of that but there was a sense of i wasn't part of a local church body and we just kind of visit around here and there it was good experience but i wasn't in a place and i remember feeling that sense of i'm not really connected to anything and then of course god aligned me so that i was connected then with the church in dallas brother jim hodges and i was quote back in my place it was that place it was that community it was that place where relations it was that one another place see i would go to these other places and i didn't know anybody so i really didn't have to love serve submit encourage all those kind of things i was a spectator i was going to see how they did their church okay that was kind of my mo at that point so but god has and i'm very convicted about this he always has a certain place and he said this is the house of god this is the gate of heaven this is a place where god dwells you know i mean he's like he laid down in this place that he thought was random and probably uncomfortable and all of a sudden he realized heaven and earth are connected there how about this word he now has access that access have two c's thank you he now has access in this place because he calls it a gate you know a gate is where you go out of sometimes for an assignment you open the door or you step through a door you step through a gate into your next assignment so this word gate this word place and this aspect that there's a dwelling of god in this place it's too much here for us to you go meditate on it and just think wow there's just a lot of stuff there and and so what did jacob do verse 18 jacob rose early in the morning and he took the stone which had been under his head and he set it as a pillar and he poured oil on it on top of it nathan grab one of those stones for me if you would please just bring it up here and set it on the table we're gonna we're gonna give an illustration all right so if you notice there's stones missing from the sign outside that's where i have them i had to get the nearest thing so you know he's like this this this place is holy god where you have taken me in this moment as a evil conniving you know uh heel grabber uh renegade i'm on the run and now all of a sudden you've downloaded abraham's blessing to me you know there's there's he probably had heard of grandpa abraham's blessing and what god had spoken to abraham he probably knew the story the narrative and all of that but now all of a sudden it's real to him so he takes that stone i'll see there was a reason i didn't put a tablecloth on there the kitchen help will be thankful that we didn't anoint that he takes the stone and what does he do he anoints it we're going to get to more of these stones in just a minute but that's such a powerful thing so there were angels there jacob was there it was a standing place that word place means standing place it means a post a city a land a locality and i think it also means a community of believers that when you come that place where god dwells now i'm not trying to hype our church if you're a guest here today just listen and enjoy and you know take it for what it is okay i'm just saying we're super special and everybody should know it right is that what i'm saying all right but we did pray for all these other pastors today too so all right a lot of good places to fellowship and be part of in the mid-ohio valley all right so the bottom line is there's a place for us to dwell a place of anointing a place of access a place that's a gate place that he wants to send out on assignments to okay so what was happening in jacob he was being realigned and reassigned see his whole life was spent getting what jacob could get now all of a sudden he's had this encounter with god and let me just say that i pray that often that god would bring encounters into people's lives because you can work as hard as you want sometimes that person's not going to change but one encounter with the spirit of god one encounter with just heaven and earth just becoming this place all of a sudden is the turning point okay god can break hard hard hearts with his powerful encounter all right so the next one and i love this one too is back in the new testament now peter is on the housetop this is acts chapter 10 and you know he's had a lot of history by now and he's really rolling and he's doing the kingdom stuff the church stuff he's an apostle he's he's doing all that and so he's on the housetop and his next realignment in his mind was or assignment was lunch okay but he decided while he was waiting for lunch that he would pray so he's up here on this house top and he's praying i don't remember what city i didn't look that up again but it was it was a a city he was in a place okay and so he's there and all of a sudden what happens is this sheet comes down out of heaven and it's got the wrong kind of animals on it you know it's got the kind of animals that you shouldn't eat if you're a jew and the spirit of god says rise kill and eat he says no lord you know and god says hey what i've called clean don't you call unclean okay i'm doing a new thing here all right so peter is up here pursuing the kingdom of god through his prayers and intercession okay he's he's trying and he's doing a good job aligning himself but little did he know there was a gentile named cornelius some miles away that was also getting aligned with the purpose of god we'll put cornelius inside of his house all right he's inside right now and what is he doing he's praying but he's also giving he's a generous man he gives out of his abundance and so he constantly is giving he's constantly praying to god he's he's an example of unbelievers that are opening their heart and they want to encounter god they want the real god in their life okay and so this is going on in the spirit god shows up and say hey cornelius i've seen your prayers i've seen your alms that you give out and i'm going to do something special for you i want you to send for this guy named peter you'll find him in joppa i remember he's in joppa by the sea and i want you to go there and to send your men there and so he did so he sends three of his men to bring peter back so you have these three men and so while peter is in his vision and the lord's talking to him and the lord said oh by the way these three men down stairs and it said they are by the gate you always look for words and see if there's any significance here these three men are at the gate gates are places of breakthrough they're places of assignment they're places of uh stepping over into the new and so peter said okay so he goes down and he says okay i guess i can go with these men you know the rest of the story when peter goes to the house of cornelius which now is filled with all kinds of people a whole he he invited all the family and everybody that had an interest in god and as peter just began to share the holy spirit just fell on that house these gentiles and peter said well i guess we can't keep the gospel from them because obviously the holy spirit's falling on them and they're praying in the spirit and we see the evidence of all that so which later on in acts 15 he gives that testimony to the the bigwigs at the jerusalem council and said hey look guys the gentiles are now receiving the gospel whether we like it or not okay so all this is happening but when when peter comes what does he bring out of his aligning and out of his assignment he brings and is used out of his anointing to preach the gospel and the holy spirit releases a greater anointing into the gentiles into cornelius that is literally why we're here today and born again because of peter now god if peter didn't cooperate you know god would have used somebody else okay we know that his purposes move on in history but peter we can look back and see that assignment so um alignment in those words in the new testament dutch sheets talked about this and give him 15 a few days ago you can go find that and go back and look there's scriptures that talk about healing and alignment and it's the same word for steve wells chiropractor taking a bone and healing or resetting a bone or a joint that brings that back into alignment what does that do it brings health and wholeness back he aligns our day and our life if we let him a couple of weeks ago maybe even last week i mentioned about worship again and it's challenged to me and all of us to put worship first in our life somehow when you get up maybe you have to run off to work as you're late or whatever just take a moment to worship the lord to give him praise to recite a scripture to look at a scripture to say okay god i want you to be first in my life i want to be so sensitive i'll i'm anointed like jesus i'm anointed like peter i'm recognizing that heaven and there's access there's an open heaven and i think this is a good thing to write down that there's an open heaven over the place where you're sending me today there's an open heaven when we gather here in this place anointing is important okay i'm going to move right along um because this is really powerful i like this part you guys have the next scripture ready now this is a passion translation which is great okay uh i mean you need to read all the trends or the translations that you feel like are best connected to the greek or hebrew i prefer new american standard tr passion translation gives you just kind of a flavorful view using other language so here we go this is first peter it says oh let's see is that first peter 2 i may have given it to him in the wrong order okay i'm gonna read it you just listen forget up there just listen to me okay don't confuse me with the facts okay all right i rearranged the order a little bit so that's probably my bad here's what peter says he says so abandon every form of evil deceit hypocrisy feelings of jealousy and slander in the same way that nursing infants cry for milk you must intensely crave the pure spiritual milk of god's word for this milk will cause you to grow into maturity fully nourished and strong for life especially now that you have had a taste of the goodness of yahweh and experienced his kindness so keep coming to him who is the living stone though he was rejected and discarded by men but chosen by god and is priceless in god's sight come and be his living stones continually being assembled into a sanctuary for god for now you serve as holy priests offering up spiritual sacrifices that he readily accepts through jesus christ for it says in the scripture look i lay a cornerstone in zion a chosen and priceless stone and whoever believes in him will certainly not be disappointed could you start bringing up those other stones as jesus is the cornerstone and just as we have shown he's the anointed one we'll we'll put him over here because he's the cornerstone and so that's first peter then you go over to uh ephesians 2 i believe it is yeah ephesians 2 19 and it says it this way so you are not foreigners or guests but you are the children of the city of the holy ones a city is a place it's the same word place look there's a hebrew word for city of the holy ones with all the rights as family members of the household of god you are rising like the perfectly fitted stones of the temple and your lives have been built together upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets best of all you're connected to the head cornerstone of the building the anointed one jesus christ himself this entire building is under construction and is continually growing under his supervision until it rises up completed as the holy temple of the lord himself this means that god is transforming each one of you into the holy of holies his dwelling place through the power of the holy spirit living in you from old testament to new testament this thing of god's it's god's house he's dwelling here peter is in a house and he's under than open heaven god's dwelling there obviously and he gets an assignment so he goes through the gate so his anointing is released where into another gathering into another house into another place he takes us from place to place but he does it with an anointing that we have received and i just love the wording here this entire building's under construction we can say freedom gate church this entire building building being people is under construction and it's and under his supervision until it rises up completed as the holy temple of the lord that might take a thousand generations that's okay we sing that song this means that god is transforming each one of you paul is saying god is at work he's transforming each one of you into the holy of holies his dwelling place through the power of the holy spirit living in you we've got to catch an individual vision and a corporate vision the individual vision is this you're no different than deceitful crooked jacob schemer you're no different i'm no different but redeemed he makes mistakes we make mistakes but yet there's an open heaven and there's a god that was pursuing him because what was pursuing him a covenant he had an assignment god's put us in the quote kingdom for such a time as this jesus the anointed one brought his kingdom so now we have the peters the pauls the james the john the disciples and all the christians down through the eras doing what aligning their lives by the anointing of the holy spirit and being assigned so there's that individual aspect and i love what paul says he said us in each one of you is the holy of holies his dwelling place because the spirit of god dwells in us but it's also corporate that he is taking these living stones and he's anointing these living stones it says he's fitting them together in the proper place for his kingdom purposes and his glory and that's who we are you know and when when people don't understand the role of the church is so that they can practice that one another and get good at it so that they can be a covenant family so that they can be those that are that we call the we use the word ekklesia called out to govern when they don't see that they're just an individual stone looking to be anointed looking for something that will help looking for something that will heal looking for something that will give them purpose in their life and all of that is good they're reading the word they're watching youtube they're doing all those things but they're not connected like let's put it that way they're not connected to what god's doing in the household so it's both individual and corporate and we've all been in those kind of situations can i have a couple of tissues please i i guess i don't mind being anointed right under my seat so nathan you want to summarize what i've been saying [Laughter] you want to help me out here oh yeah let's see what he's got i got to get a drink anyways give it your best shot nathan [Music] just giving you more time to think that's all right so i think i think i remember you using the word living stones something like last week in one of our meetings and you know how you can hear the same thing over and over and over and over and over again it never means anything to you and then i don't know i was driving down the road and it kind of clicked to me i was like oh living stone we are the living stones now how many times have i heard that or you guys have heard that but it was in that moment that it clicked and then brought to mind jesus as the cornerstone of which upon things are built and then how he uses each one of our lives as something that's not dead but something that he's redeeming to bring alive and then it's from that building in our lives and what he's doing through us in our lives that through and then well then through covenant the the connection of each one of these blocks so we are the living stone and then the covenant relationship that we have with god allows us to have relationship with others and it's through that covenant relationship with god that allows the building of his kingdom here on earth and it's this ever growing ever increasing kingdom which is seen all throughout the new testament that's pretty good yeah i like that [Applause] all right all you living stones if you would stand up we are purposely being a little bit abbreviated today because this is one of those living stone sundays we call our connect time that's why you're wearing a badge you say why am i wearing a name don't people know well because we're trying to be intentional in it bob it's good to see you haven't seen you in a while amen see i like seeing the living stones that i haven't seen in a while amen chuck it's good to see you back there i know you've been traveling back and forth to beckley and taking care of mom and and all of that and so that's good and shane finally came back from wyoming north dakota wherever he was on his motorcycle and so i can start naming names it's just great to see the living stones that have this covenant connection and kingdom purpose so as we end let me just say it again you are anointed there's an anointing that god has intended for you to carry it might be in the classroom it might be in the home it might be in different marketplace situations the anointing is not just for teaching sunday school or preaching okay the anointing is not just for something that you do with the bible in your hand the anointing is what you do and what you who you are and what you carry and so out of that anointing comes this work of aligning let the holy spirit do that you know uh don't kick against the goads as the scripture says you know let the holy spirit align our lives you know he's i won't give those testimonies but he's done drastic aligning in our lives over the years and then assigning because out of that aligning will become that gate place we're called freedom gate church so out of the freedom it was for freedom that christ has set us free out of that freedom we have confidence and we step through the gate into whatever the assignment is and if you're here today and you said you know what i you know first off you may say i don't know the lord or i've been away from the lord and i had no sense of that anointing in my life the scripture talks about being born again you know we've all sinned and come short of the glory of god right and god wants to change our lives transform us that word transform is right here in this last scripture this means god is transforming each one of you the biggest transformation is when we turn our life over to jesus say i want you to be lord of my life i want you to forgive my past and my sins and i want to be transformed and changed not so i can be super christian not so i can be look like some old testament saying but it's just simply so i can live under an open heaven so i can walk in alignment and and be who god has called me to be because that's where the excitement and the adventure and the joy and the hope and the healing and all of that come amen so you're anointed you're being aligned and assigned and you know what peter loved god enough to obey and i bet peter after what took place here i bet he had some good good gentiles that he loved as well that he became in relationship with even though god ultimately sent him primarily to the

pour oil anointing oil on each one here to receive fully everything that you have for their lives for their children for their husbands their wives maybe sons or daughters that are far off or
